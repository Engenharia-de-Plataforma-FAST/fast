## 1. Download GCP credentials

Download the GCP service account key from your GCP project, rename it to `credential.json` and copy it to the `packer` and also `terraform` folders.

## 2. Edit parameters

Edit packer parameters within `packer/variables.pkrvars.hcl` with your public key hash and your private key path. Also, change your project ID (you can get it from GCP main dashboard).

Do the same within `terraform/input.tfvars`, but this time the project number is needed (you can also get it from GCP main dashboard).

## 3. Allow SSH

Since we will be using the `default` network, ensure the network has a firewall rule to allow SSH to your IP address or anyone (0.0.0.0/0). The rule should be created with network tag = `allow-ssh`.

## 4. Create the image

```
cd packer
./run.sh
```

## 5. Create the infrastructure

```
cd terraform
./deploy.sh
```

## 6. Destroy the infrastructure

After finishing the lab, remove the infra to avoid unnecessary costs.

```
cd terraform
./destroy.sh
```

Confirm with a `yes`.

## 7. Clean

Clean terraform files if you wish to start a fresh new lab. In case you will maintain the infra, DON'T do this, since the `tfstate` files will be remoevd.

```
cd terraform
./clean.sh
```
